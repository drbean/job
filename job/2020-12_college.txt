I'm applying to teach English at your school.

After 12 years at 國立聯合大學, the school terminated me last semester, apparently because of my age. But I'm still fired with enthusiasm about teaching and about language.

In addition, I am fully equipped to teach online in the new COVID-19 era, with my Moodle site, https://toeic.moodlecloud.com (requires log-in).

Even if you don't have any empty teaching slots, what I propose to you is that you offer to your students some extra elective courses that I would teach. If student enrolment in those classes doesn't meet the required number (of 15 students?), the class does not proceed, and I don't get paid anything.

Electives I could teach which have proved popular at NUU include TOEIC Speaking & Writing Prep, and Anime for Speaking and Listening.

See my TOEIC and anime course slides at the second link, ClassContent, on my home page, http://drbean.sdf.org, or go directly to http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/Contents.html

Looking forward to hearing from you.
