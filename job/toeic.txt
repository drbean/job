I've put the TOEIC Speaking course I taught at NUU using other people's youtube videos online, at https://toeic.moodlecloud.com.

I think it is of some value. Please bring it to the attention of interested students.

I don't intend to try and make money from it, but I do want to promote it among the Taiwan professoriate and perhaps induce them to give me editing work.
