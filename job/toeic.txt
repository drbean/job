I've put the TOEIC Speaking course I taught at NUU using other people's youtube videos online, at https://toeic.moodlecloud.com.

I think it is of some value. Please bring it to the attention of interested students.

And, by the way, I'm still offering my Academic Editing Service. Here is the sales pitch again.

Let me promote my academic paper editing service, "the next best thing to a journal editor at your side ON your side."

I do a good job because of i) my English language skills (see my old GRE scores in my resume), ii) the care with which I express myself, and iii) my desire to understand even difficult material.

In the last year or so, the NUU 語文中心 has promoted me on its Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/nuulc/photos/英文論文編輯服務你在寫英文論文嗎需要專業人士幫你校稿嗎需要英文寫作諮商嗎聯合大學語文中心提供付費英文論文編輯服務由外籍教師且母語為英語的專業人士協助您修改出高品/346777209352544/

And I have edited the papers of a number of NUU researchers.

Three Testimonials

I, Hsiao-fang Cheng, former chairperson of Language Center, have asked Greg to proofread quite a few academic papers. He is a master proofreader and consultant. If you need someone to help with your English writing, contact him right away.--程小芳

I am very satisfied with the proofreading and editing work done by Greg. He is excellent in making claims strong and spotting Chinese English sentences. In addition, he spent time discussing with the author the parts which were unclear. I highly recommend Greg's professionalism in editing.--呂宜玲

I appreciate Greg's editing ability and discussions of English grammar--董東錦

Please feel free to contact me, just to say, "Hello", even if you don't want me to edit your work.

Let me share two excellent writing sites:

1. GMU's writing guides, developed for college students, have good advice about the process of writing.

See the comments on the academic paper's Introduction, Method, Results and Discussion sections:

https://writingcenter.gmu.edu/guides/imrad-reports-introductions
https://writingcenter.gmu.edu/guides/writing-an-imrad-report
https://writingcenter.gmu.edu/guides/imrad-reports-conclusions

2. Academic Phrasebank gives you the words to say what you are trying to do at certain points in your paper.

For example, hedges, as explained by https://writingcenter.gmu.edu/guides/hedges-softening-claims-in-academic-writing

The Academic Phrasebank suggests when you want to be cautious about interpreting results, http://www.phrasebank.manchester.ac.uk/using-cautious-language/, you can say:

	These data must be interpreted with caution because …
	These results therefore need to be interpreted with caution.

People in Taiwan have been very generous to me, I have for many years benefited from free software and I always appreciate vendors who offer good service at low prices, so I want to return the favor by keeping to the rock-bottom recommended 科技部 rate of 0.5元 per word.

Thanks for reading this far. I look forward to hearing from you.
